# <Bake and Brew>

## Use ingredients you have to get ideas for meals you can make with them.

As developers, we wanted to create a Web App that will allow people to get recipe ideas based on the ingredients in their homes and suggest a beer paring.


## User Story

As a user,\
WHEN I input the ingredients that I have,\
THEN a list is created of those ingredients and stored locally.\
WHEN the "Clear Ingredient" button is clicked,\
THEN the ingredient list is cleared.\
WHEN I click submit,\
THEN recipe cards are generated from the ingredient list, with a beer to accompany them.\
WHEN I click on the recipe I choose,\
THEN I am taken to a new tab that gives me the recipe.\
WHEN the "Clear" button is clicked,\
THEN the recipe list is cleared.
